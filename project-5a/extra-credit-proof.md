Claim: It is possible to produce any process tree structure consisting of at most 8 nodes, with the top root node labeled
as 1 and the other nodes labeled by distinct numbers from 2 through 8, using the fork, switch, and exit system calls in the
MT system.

Proof by Induction:

Base Case: For a process tree with 1 node, there is only one possible structure, which is the root node labeled as 1.
This structure can be trivially produced by starting with process 1 (P1).

Inductive Step: Assume that it is possible to produce any process tree structure with n nodes (1 <= n <= 7), with the root
node labeled as 1 and the other nodes labeled by distinct numbers from 2 to n+1. We need to show that it is possible to produce
any process tree structure with n+1 nodes, with the root node labeled as 1 and the other nodes labeled by distinct numbers from
2 to n+2.

Consider an arbitrary process tree structure with n+1 nodes. We can construct this tree structure by:

1. Starting with any process tree structure with n nodes, which is possible by the inductive hypothesis.
2. Let P be any process in the existing n-node tree, including the root process 1 (P1).
3. Execute the fork system call from process P to create a new child process with unique PID, n+2.
4. If the new node (labeled n+2) needs to be a child of a different process Q, execute the switch system call to switch to process Q,
and then execute the fork system call from Q to create the new child process with PID n+2.
5. If the new node (labeled n+2) needs to be a leaf node, no further action is required.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as needed to create the desired parent-child relationships between the new node (labeled n+2) and the
existing nodes.

Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, it is possible to produce any process tree structure consisting 
of at most 8 nodes, with the top root node labeled as 1 and the other nodes labeled by distinct numbers from 2 through 8, 
using the fork, switch, and exit system calls in the MT system.
